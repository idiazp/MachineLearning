# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Key Concepts:
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Involves one independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves more than one independent variable.

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables. The model predicts the dependent variable as a weighted sum of the independent variables.
