# Classification Methods

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes or labels.

## Common Classification Methods:
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees**: Breaks down data by asking a series of questions.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds a hyperplane that best separates classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies data based on the closest data points.

Each of these methods has its strengths depending on the type of data and the problem being solved.
